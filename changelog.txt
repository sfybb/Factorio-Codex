    - Now showing information like new recipes and modifiers for technologies.

  Quick Search Features:

  Features:
    - Added support for the mod "Lua API global Variable Viewer (gvv)" (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/gvv).
  Changes:
    - Completely new code base, it is only equal in functionally. No line was untouched.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.14
Date: 08.02.2023
  Codex Features:
    - Recipes don't show any items/fluids that require/produce 0 units unless this is the only ingredient/product (the other ingredients/products are still shown. This manly affects the Arcosphere recipes in SE).
  Quick Search Features:
    - Text input doesn't fight you in multiplayer anymore (this adds a very small delay to the search results).
  Features:
    - Re-translation after changes to the mods (Anything that was translated before remains searchable while the re-translation is ongoing).
  Changes:

Version: 0.0.13
Date: 31.01.2023

Date: 31.01.2023

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.11
Date: 30.01.2023

    - Codex: added color indicator for fluids.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed in-game changelog.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.10
Date: 22.01.2023
  Codex Features:
    - Removed Item description beside the item. Hovering the big icon still displays the item description.
    - Added rocket launch product support (only supports one rocket silo type for now - meaning this won't show the correct rocket silo for production in space exploration).
    - Added mine-able resources and offshore-pump products to "Produced In" tab, also shows mining productivity effects (by showing increased production amount).
    - Clicking on resource vein icons (added by for mine-able resources) or the current item/fluid is disabled.
  Features:
    - Migrations able to migrate properly now. This means if you had the codex open it should still be open at the same position (same item/fluid) after migration.
  Bugs:
    - If the codex was open before migration the item/fluid list will not scroll to it (this does not affect the scrolling that happens when an ingredient/product gets clicked or the codex gets opened by quick search).
  Changes:
    - Removed most of the old unknown bugs and replaced them with new unknown bugs! (This is due to a lot - I mean A LOT - of changes to the underlying code).
