Version: 0.0.10
  Features:
    - Codex: Added rocket launch product support (only supports one rocket silo type for now - meaning this wont show the correct rocket silo for production in space exploration)
    - Codex: Added mine-able resources and offshore-pump products to "Produced In" tab, also shows mining productivity effects (by showing increased production amount)
    - Codex: Clicking on resource vein icons (added by for mine-able resources) or the current item/fluid is disabled
    - Migrations able to migrate properly now. This means if you had the codex open it should still be open at the same position (same item/fluid) after migration
  Bugs:
    - If the codex was open before migration the item/fluid list will not scroll to it (this does not affect the scrolling that happens when an ingredient/product gets clicked or the codex gets opened by quick search)
  Other:
    - Removed most of unknown old bugs and replaced them with new unknown bugs! (This is due to a lot - I mean A LOT - of changes to the underlying code)
