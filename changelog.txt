Version: 0.0.14
Date: 08.02.2023
  Features:
    - Quick Search: Text input doesn't fight you in multiplayer anymore (this adds a very small delay to the search results).
    - Codex: Recipes don't show any items/fluids that require/produce 0 units unless this is the only ingredient/product (the other ingredients/products are still shown. This manly affects the Arcosphere recipes in SE).
    - Re-translation after changes to the mods (Anything that was translated before remains searchable while the re-translation is ongoing).
  Changes:
    - Under the hood changes to hopefully fix de-syncs once and for all (queue the next de-sync bug).
  Debug:
    - Added more log messages.

Version: 0.0.13
Date: 31.01.2023
  Features:
    - Deactivated validate outside of migration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.12
Date: 31.01.2023
  Features:
    - Added missing file to zip.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.11
Date: 30.01.2023
  Features:
    - Codex: added color indicator for fluids.
    - Validating saved mod data on migration to resolve some bugs. In some cases quick search and/or the codex reset, you will get notified if this happens.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed in-game changelog.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.10
Date: 22.01.2023
  Features:
    - Codex: Removed Item description beside the item. Hovering the big icon still displays the item description.
    - Codex: Added rocket launch product support (only supports one rocket silo type for now - meaning this won't show the correct rocket silo for production in space exploration).
    - Codex: Added mine-able resources and offshore-pump products to "Produced In" tab, also shows mining productivity effects (by showing increased production amount).
    - Codex: Clicking on resource vein icons (added by for mine-able resources) or the current item/fluid is disabled.
    - Migrations able to migrate properly now. This means if you had the codex open it should still be open at the same position (same item/fluid) after migration.
  Bugs:
    - If the codex was open before migration the item/fluid list will not scroll to it (this does not affect the scrolling that happens when an ingredient/product gets clicked or the codex gets opened by quick search).
  Other:
    - Removed most of the old unknown bugs and replaced them with new unknown bugs! (This is due to a lot - I mean A LOT - of changes to the underlying code).

  Bugs:
    - (fixed in a later versiom) When loading a save where this mod was previously active it is possible that the migration script crashes. (Workaround: disable mod -> load save -> save and exit -> re-enable mod -> load save).
    - (unable to reproduce in test environment) When looking at some recipes it is possible for players with different languages to de-sync.
