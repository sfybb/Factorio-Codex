# Factorio Codex
This mod adds a Satisfactory like codex and quick search to factorio.
Currently this mod is in it's Alpha stages. This means this mod might not be stable and there will be a changes in the future to the functionality and maybe ui.

# Functionality
## Quick Search
By default you can open quick search by pressing the n key on your keyboard.
This opens a textbox you can type into to search for items or technologies.
When you find what you searched for you can click on the search result and the codex will open and show more information about what you clicked on.

If you need a quick calculator you can also use the quick search functionality and you will have the answer to these pesky calculations in no time!
The calculator supports the basic arithmetic operators like + - * / additionally you can also use brackets () or exponents ^.

## Codex
Shows more information about items, fluids etc.
Currently only the in game description and possible recipes are shown.
However rocket launch products and maybe other things aren't visible yet
